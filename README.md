# ComponentInserter
Put the .rbxmx file in your plugins folder

Allows you to easily insert StateComponents into your InfiltrationEngine custom mission, as well as view brief but useful descriptions for listed StateComponents and their attributes

Inserting StateComponents will not work if there is not a DebugMission folder in the Workspace

Activate the plugin to create a widget containing a list of StateComponents. You can use the search box to filter for specific StateComponents. You can click on the name of a StateComponent to insert it into the StateComponents folder of your MissionSetup folder. You can press the "?" button next to a StateComponent's name in the list to view useful info about it and its attributes. Overall, this helps to create more accessibility and spread information in the realm of creating custom missions

Also it has light mode support
